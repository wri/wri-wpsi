# README

This is the main repo for the Water, Peace and Security web app.

## Ruby version

See [.ruby-version](/.ruby-version) definition.

## System dependencies

See [Gemfile](/Gemfile) and [package.json](/package.json).

You also need chromedriver in order to run tests. Try `brew cask install chromedriver`.
You will need to update chromedriver when you update chrome (`brew cask upgrade chromedriver`)

## Setup

* `bundle` to install ruby gems.
* `yarn` to install node modules.
* `rake db:create db:migrate db:test:prepare` to initialize the databases.
* `bin/ci-build` to run all tests and checks.
* `foreman start -f Procfile.dev` to run the app locally.
* `rake db:fixtures:load` to fill the app with realistic layers and categories.

## Linting

Ruby code is linted by `rubocop` and JS code is linted by `eslint`. Both are run and enforced automatically when you try to commit new changes via `overcommit`. You may need to run `overcommit --install` the first time to get this to work.

## Testing

* `bin/ci-build` runs code audits and the test suite and is what TravisCI runs. Check it out for things you might test locally.
  * Use `rails test` to run ruby unit tests.
  * Use `rails test:system` to run ruby system tests.
  * Run system tests with `DEBUG_CHROME=1` to watch them execute in real time.
  * Use `yarn test` to run JS tests with Jest.

### Jest tests

Jest tests will fail whenever a snapshot becomes out of date. This does not mean there is something wrong with the code! It is an opportunity to check if the output of our abstracted HTML-generating code changed in the way that we intended.

If the changes all look good, update the failing snapshots by running `yarn test -u`.

## Deploying

Staging is deployed to heroku at `https://git.heroku.com/wri-wpsi.git`. Run `git push heroku staging:main` to deploy the staging branch there.

Production is deployed to a `Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS` server at IHE Delft. Run `cap production deploy` to deploy there. Consult
`config/deploy/production.rb` for where that is. You will need to get your credentials set up by a current deployer.
You will also need to be on the office network in order to connect.

`capistrano` tasks for starting and stopping the services are set up per https://github.com/seuros/capistrano-puma.  All necessary services are manageable via systemd and enabled on boot.

To setup slackistrano notifications triggred by your deploys, you need to add the WRI_SLACK_WEBHOOK variable to your local environment with a valid Slack webhook URI.

#### Services

```
* puma.service - puma for production
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/puma.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

## Exception monitoring

Exceptions are monitored via [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/organizations/green-river/issues/?project=1484102).

## Widgets

### Importing widget data from the CSV data table

All widget data is loaded into the app's database for easier access and exposed via a simple API ([see below](#using-the-widget-api)). To load the data, use the [`import:widget_datapoints` rake task](/lib/tasks/import.rake):

1. Download the CSV file to the computer where you are running the rake task

  * I usually download it locally and then rsync it to the wri server, with a command like `rsync -aP ~/Downloads/data_final_results_Y2021M12_wps_widget_data_Y2021M12_v3.csv wri-prod:csvs/`

2. Run the task with the path to the file as a parameter, something like:

```
rake 'import:widget_datapoints[/Users/lucas/Downloads/data_final_results_Y2021M12_wps_widget_data_Y2021M12_v3.csv]'
```

In order to copy the CSV into the production database, you will need to specify the environment like this:

```bash
cd ~/current && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake 'import:widget_datapoints[/home/amichal/csvs/data_final_results_Y2021M12_wps_widget_data_Y2021M12_v3.csv]'
```

(Takes about 1 to 2 minutes)

### Widgets API / Map Summary

This app's widgets datapoints api exposes the widgets_datapoints values as CSV or json. It is used when a geographic region is selected on the map to populate the sidebar. The map will load the layer.widget_spec (vega spec) which may reference API urls in (via urlTemplate). Additionally there is a download link which uses exports all rows as CSV for the region selected region.

The clickable regions (admin 1) are independent of the other datasets in the map (e.g. energy use). Many of the datasets are not even choropleths. The dataset layers in the map are pulled from an external service, [CARTO](https://resourcewatch.carto.com/u/wri-rw/me)

### Writing widget specifications

The app accepts [standard vega chart specifications](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/specification/) with just one additional feature. If the spec includes a value for `data.urlTemplate` it will set `data.url` based on that template, substituting in the currently selected region id for any occurrences of the string `${region.gid_1}`.

This is intended for use with the single-endpoint widget data API (see below).

### Using the widget API

| Method | URL                                                  | Description
|--------|------------------------------------------------------|------------
| GET    | api/v1/widget_datapoints/`region_id`/`variable`/     | Returns all datapoints for the given `region_id` and `variable`:<ul><li>`region_id` should be a gid_1 like `AFG.10_1`</li><li>`variable` should be an identifier for one of the model variables, matching [one of the headers from the data csv](/db/schema.rb#L64-L138).</li></ul>

The api returns JSON containing an array of "data points". Each datapoint has the following fields:

* gid_1 (administrative level 1)
* month_date
* year
* `variable` (whatever variable was specified in the request)

Here is an example query and its result:

```JSON
// https://waterpeacesecurity.org/api/v1/widget_datapoints/AFG.10_1/gid_0/

{
  "widget_datapoints": [
    {
      "gid_1": "AFG.10_1",
      "month_date": "2000-01-01",
      "year": 2000,
      "gid_0": "AFG"
    },
    {
      "gid_1": "AFG.10_1",
      "month_date": "2000-02-01",
      "year": 2000,
      "gid_0": "AFG"
    },
    {
      "gid_1": "AFG.10_1",
      "month_date": "2000-03-01",
      "year": 2000,
      "gid_0": "AFG"
    },
  ]
}
```
